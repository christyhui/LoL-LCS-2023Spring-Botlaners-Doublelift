 Analysis of Doublelift and the 2023 LCS Spring Split Bot Laners

Thank you to OraclesElixir for the data: https://oracleselixir.com/

A Reddit post briefly analyzing the data is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11kfdor/how_has_doublelift_been_doing_since_his_comeback/

There are things I would improve on for this project if I were to do it again. These include:

1. Add the total gametally to graphs in a way that makes the graphs easy to interpret so we can better understand whether or not the stat is "a lie or not."
2. Filter players that played at least 2 games (so more than a week)
3. Use more functions and for loops and get better at list comprehension so I do not have to keep copy pasting.
4. Write more comments so I better understand what I am doing.
5. Write an actual analysis on the .ipynb instead so I can get into better detail. I did 0 analysis on this notebook.
